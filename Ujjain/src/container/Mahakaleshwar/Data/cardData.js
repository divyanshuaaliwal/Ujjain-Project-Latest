The temple has witnessed several destructions and reconstructions throughout history, with the current structure being built by the Maratha general Ranoji Shinde in the 18th century. The temple's historical significance is also mentioned in ancient Hindu texts like the Puranas, which describe Ujjain as one of the seven sacred cities of Hindu pilgrimage.",
